      "A 31-year-old, previously healthy woman began having episodes of flashing zigzag lights in her left visual field 2 months ago. She had over 40 attacks in the left visual field, but none in the right. An episode consists of a paracentral, flickering dot of light expanding to a C-shaped figure of zigzag colored lights. The open end of the C faces the center of the visual field. The C-shaped figure expands during a period of 20 min over the left homonymous visual field to migrate to the left periphery. Headache may precede an episode, but never follows it. Prior to 2 months ago, she never experienced migraine headaches. Family history is negative for migraine.
